= Test rig for go

This test rig will build and run the grammar file test.g4 with the `input` file for local testing by maintainers.

You should copy the `dev` branch version of the antlr4 complete jar in to the antlr directory if it is
different to the one currently in the antlr directory (it usually isn't if and you are on the dev branch of this
repo.

You can then run
```sh
go generate ./...
go build .
```

You can change the `test` and `test_test.go` files to call the grammar you are working on (test.g4) and the input file
you want to test (`input`, in the same directory as test.go).
